  The problem:
Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find the length of shortest trans-
formation sequence from start to end, such that:
Only one letter can be changed at a time Each intermediate word must exist in the
dictionary For example, Given:
start = "hit"
end = "cog"
dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
As one shortest transformation is "hit" ->"hot" ->"dot" ->"dog" ->"cog", the program should return its length 5.
Note: Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence. All words have the same length. All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
This problem is a classic problem that has been asked frequently during interviews.

  The following are two Java solutions.
